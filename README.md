## AI Capability Maturity Model
One of the largest challenges currently is a realization that organizations performing machine learning, is to have a repeatable and scalable (horizontally and vertically) Machine Learning foundation and process. Herein lies a model that in itself can be adapted and changed over time. 

Level 0  - Secure Cloud infrastructure 
    Ability to consistently scale and share AI services and resources horizontally and vertically
Level 1 - Data Pipeline created with a continuous delivery of data
Level 2 - Agile Software Development process formed
Level 3 - Operational requirements process formed
Level 4 - Ability to conduct Exploratory and Deep Data Analysis and share and catalog results
Level 5 - Has a Traditional ML Process with ability to measure, share and catalog results
Level 6 - Has a AutoML Process with ability to measure, share and catalog results
Level 7 - ML Operational Feedback Loop measures effectiveness
